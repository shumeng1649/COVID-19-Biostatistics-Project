# COVID-19-Biostatistics-Project
This repository details a multilevel ecological analysis investigating the association between political ideology and public health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The project focuses on county- and state-level data to examine how factors like political ideology relate to observed COVID-19 incidence and mortality.

## Research Question:

The primary aim of this study is to examine whether political ideology (Trump vote share) predicts county-level COVID-19 incidence. Other demographic and socioeconomic variables were included as covariates to adjust for potential confounding.

## Results:

The effect of political ideology remained significant after controlling for age, race, education, income, insurance rate, and population density.
(Then one sentence noting covariates briefly.)

## Discussion:
Demographic covariates were not the focus of the study, but their significance is consistent with existing research (older age → higher risk, etc.)
